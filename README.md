The Odin Project Googe Homepage Mini Project

Introduction:
This project aims to apply some of the work I've done learning HTML, CSS, and Chrome Developer Tools. The goal is to recreate the Google hompage. Optionally, I can also create the Google search results page, which I plan to do for practice. 


Skills I've gained in completing this project:
-Ability and confidence to use the inspector
-Ability to manipulate different elements of a webpage in multiple ways
-Experience googling how to do things and tweaking them to my project
-Beginning to understand how all the files in a webpage start to work together

Reflection:
You can spend a really long time being a perfectionist, and in small projects that may not be ideal. I was actually able to use skills I learned doing this project to help my intern buddy this summer with one of his projects, which felt great. I feel like I'm starting to get a more solid understanding of how a website works.
